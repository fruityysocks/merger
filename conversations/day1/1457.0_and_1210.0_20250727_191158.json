How about you?\nSpeaker 1: Can't complain, it's just an other beautiful day in the neighborhood. You been keeping up with the Red Sox?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they've been doing pretty well this season. I've been trying to catch the games between my studies. \nSpeaker 1: That's good, you gotta take a break every now and then. What are you studying anyway?\nSpeaker 2: I'm studying Criminal Justice at UMass Boston. It's a bit tough but I'm managing.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's interesting. Actually, I work as a security guard here in Malden. It's not exactly the same but we're both in the safety field, huh?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's true. What's it like being a security guard?\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's not always glamorous. Mostly, it's just making sure things are safe and secure. But every now and then, things get a little interesting.\nSpeaker 2: Sounds like it could be stressful at times. I guess that's part of the job though, right?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you got that right. It's all about maintaining calm and order. What made you decide to study Criminal Justice?\nSpeaker 2: I've always been interested in the justice system. I guess I just want to make a difference, you know?\nSpeaker 1: That's a noble cause. The world could always use more people looking out for justice.\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, I appreciate that. It's not easy, but I believe it's worth it.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely, and who knows, maybe one day you'll be the one keeping this neighborhood safe.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, who knows? That'd be something, wouldn't it?\nSpeaker 1: Definitely. Just remember, no matter how tough it gets, just keep pushing. That's something I've learned in my job.\nSpeaker 2: I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the advice.\nSpeaker 1: Anytime, neighbor. Good luck with your studies.",
