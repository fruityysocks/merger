Just finished my morning run. \nSpeaker 2: That's nice. Wish I could do that, but I'm not much of a morning person. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can't start the day without it. Any new project you're working on?\nSpeaker 2: Actually, yes, I'm working on a new bridge design, quite challenging but exciting.\nSpeaker 1: That sounds interesting. I always admired the precision and creativity needed in your field.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Sarah. It is indeed a demanding profession, but I love it. How about nursing? I believe it's equally challenging.\nSpeaker 1: Oh definitely, every day is a new challenge. But it's rewarding to see patients recover and get back to their normal lives.\nSpeaker 2: I can imagine. It must be a great feeling to make such a direct impact on people's lives.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it is. It's stressful at times, but it's worth it. Speaking of which, I should head off now. My shift starts in an hour.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I won't keep you then. Have a good day at work, Sarah. \nSpeaker 1: You too, John. Good luck with your bridge design. I can't wait to hear more about it.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Sarah. I'm looking forward to telling you more. Take care.",
