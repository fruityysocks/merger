  "original_conversation": "Speaker 1: Hey there, how\u2019s your day going?\nSpeaker 2: Not too bad, can't complain. How about you?\nSpeaker 1: Same here. Just finished mowing the lawn. The grass grows really fast this time of year, doesn't it?\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you're not kidding. I swear I just mowed mine a few days ago and it already looks like a jungle again.\nSpeaker 1: I can relate. It's almost like a full-time job, right?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and I already have one of those. Speaking of, how's your work going at the facility?\nSpeaker 1: It's been quite busy. We've been installing new AC units in all the buildings. It's heavy work, but it has to be done before the summer heat hits.\nSpeaker 2: Sounds like a lot of work indeed. I can't imagine hauling those big machines around. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's tough, but it keeps you active. How about you? How\u2019s the retail business treating you?\nSpeaker 2: It's been a bit hectic, to be honest. We've been trying to keep up with the demand since more people started shopping in-store again.\nSpeaker 1: That's a good sign though, isn't it? It means things are getting back to normal.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is. But it also means more work for us. Stocking shelves, dealing with customers, it never ends.\nSpeaker 1: I can only imagine. But at least you're indoors, away from the unpredictable New England weather.\nSpeaker 2: That's true, I can't argue with that. But I won't lie, sometimes I wish I could be outside, even if it means dealing with the weather.\nSpeaker 1: Grass is always greener, isn\u2019t it? We always want what we don't have.\nSpeaker 2: You got that right. But at the end of the day, we both do what we got to do, right?\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. We do what we need to, to keep the lights on. \nSpeaker 2: Couldn't have said it better myself. Anyway, I better get going. I've got a lawn to conquer.\nSpeaker 1: Ha! Good luck with that. Catch you later, neighbor.\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, you too. See you around!",
