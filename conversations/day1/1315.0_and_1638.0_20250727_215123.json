  "original_conversation": "Speaker 1: Hey there, nice day isn't it?\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely! The weather has been pretty decent these past few days.\nSpeaker 1: I know right. It's the perfect weather for a jog around the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 2: Agreed, I see you've been keeping up with your morning runs. \nSpeaker 1: Yes, I am trying to stay fit. You know, it's important for both physical and mental health.\nSpeaker 2: That's true. It's equally important to find balance. How's your study going, by the way?\nSpeaker 1: It's going well, thanks for asking. I've been busy preparing for the mid-terms. How about you? \nSpeaker 2: Same here, I've been swamped with assignments and presentations. It's a bit hectic.\nSpeaker 1: I can relate to that. What subjects are you finding tough this semester?\nSpeaker 2: Physics is a bit challenging for me this time. It's just hard to visualize some of the concepts. \nSpeaker 1: Oh, I get that completely. I struggled with Physics too, but then I found some helpful YouTube channels that made things a lot easier.\nSpeaker 2: Really? Could you recommend some of them?\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I'll text you the links later. What about your favorite subjects this semester?\nSpeaker 2: I'd say Computer Science. I have always been interested in coding and algorithms.\nSpeaker 1: That's interesting. I find Computer Science a bit daunting, but I'm trying to learn some basics.\nSpeaker 2: I could help you out with that. We could start a study group or something.\nSpeaker 1: That sounds like a great idea! Let's plan something over the weekend.\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good. I'm glad we could find a way to help each other out.\nSpeaker 1: Me too, it's always better when we can share resources and learn together.\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely, looking forward to it. Let's catch up soon, then? \nSpeaker 1: Definitely, see you soon. And thanks for the chat!",
