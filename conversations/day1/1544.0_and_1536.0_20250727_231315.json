  "original_conversation": "Speaker 1: Hi there, isn't it a beautiful day out here in Maine?\nSpeaker 2: It sure is, I love when the weather starts to get warmer. You can feel that spring is in the air.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely, the birds are chirping away and the flowers are starting to bloom. It's just lovely.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, and it's the perfect time for a walk along the beach. Do you ever go to Ferry Beach State Park?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I love going there. The nature trails are so peaceful and it's a great place to relax.\nSpeaker 2: I agree, I often go there with my clients to have our sessions in a calm environment. It's a different approach to traditional social work.\nSpeaker 1: That sounds interesting! I didn't know that social workers could have sessions outside of an office.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's a relatively new concept called ecotherapy. It's about using nature to improve mental health. I find it very effective.\nSpeaker 1: That's fascinating! It seems like it would be really beneficial to your clients.\nSpeaker 2: It does seem to help them a lot. But enough about me, what about you? How are your studies going?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, they're going well. I've been focusing a lot on my psychology courses recently, they're really interesting.\nSpeaker 2: Ah, psychology. That's a great field. Are you planning on using that in your future career?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm actually hoping to become a school counselor. I want to help kids navigate through their school years.\nSpeaker 2: That's a wonderful goal. It's so important to have good support systems in schools. \nSpeaker 1: I agree. It's something I'm really passionate about. I believe every child should have someone they can talk to. \nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. It sounds like you're going to do great things in your career. If you ever need any advice or want to talk about the field, feel free to reach out to me.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, I'll definitely keep that in mind. It was nice talking to you.\nSpeaker 2: Likewise. Enjoy the rest of this beautiful day. See you around!",
