How's work at the tech company?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it's got its ups and downs. Sometimes, it's troubleshooting all day.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can only imagine.

It's important to find something you love in your work. \n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. Speaking of work, I'm having some issues with my computer at home. Do you think you could help me pick out some tickets for the next game online?\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course! I'd be happy to help you navigate the website. Let's get you those tickets.",
