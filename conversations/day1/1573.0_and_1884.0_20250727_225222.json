  "original_conversation": "Speaker 1: Good morning, George. What a beautiful day it is here in Westfield, isn't it?\nSpeaker 2: Morning, Marianne. Yeah, it's a real peach of a day. Got any plans?\nSpeaker 1: Just some light gardening and then a bit of paperwork from the high school. How about you?\nSpeaker 2: Likely working on my old Chevy in the garage. Needs a bit of TLC.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's right. You've always had a knack for fixing things, haven't you?\nSpeaker 2: Well, you don't work as a mechanical engineer for years without picking up a few things.\nSpeaker 1: I suppose that's true. And it must come in handy around the house too!\nSpeaker 2: It does. But don't think I don't envy your job at times, Marianne. Proctoring has its own set of challenges.\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, I assure you. Managing the exam rooms can get quite stressful.\nSpeaker 2: I can imagine. All those young minds, full of hopes and dreams, and fears, I suppose.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. The stress levels can be quite high, especially during the major exams. But I do my best to provide a calm atmosphere.\nSpeaker 2: That's important. I remember my exam days, not a period in my life I'd like to relive, I tell you.\nSpeaker 1: I can imagine. But then, you moved onto engineering. That must have been quite a shift.\nSpeaker 2: It was. But I've always loved figuring out how things work, you know? Engineering just seemed like a natural fit.\nSpeaker 1: It sounds fascinating, George. I've always admired people who can understand machines.\nSpeaker 2: Well, and I admire those who can handle teenagers. Each to their own, I suppose.\nSpeaker 1: I suppose so. Well, I better get moving. Those roses won't prune themselves.\nSpeaker 2: And that Chevy isn't going to fix itself. Have a good day, Marianne.\nSpeaker 1: You too, George. Enjoy your day.",
