It's a beautiful day, isn't it?\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely, the sunshine just brightens everything up. I've been spending most of my day in the garden. \nSpeaker 2: Oh, that sounds wonderful. I've been cooped up inside for most of the day.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's too bad. But I guess work keeps us occupied, doesn't it?\nSpeaker 2: Yes indeed, it does. I've been working on a lengthy transcription today. \nSpeaker 1: Oh, you're a transcriber, correct? That sounds like quite a meticulous job.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's quite detailed. It needs a lot of focus and patience. And how about you? What do you do?\nSpeaker 1: I'm self-employed, I run my own little boutique right here in Johnston.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's fantastic. What kind of items do you sell in your boutique?\nSpeaker 1: Well, I sell locally made crafts \u2013 you know, handcrafted jewelry, pottery, even some homemade jams. \nSpeaker 2: That sounds delightful! I bet it's a lot of work though.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it can be quite a handful at times. But it's also so rewarding, you know, supporting local craftsmen.\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. I can imagine it's satisfying to see your business support the local community.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely, it\u2019s a joy. But I guess in your line of work, you also get to encounter some interesting pieces of information while transcribing, don\u2019t you?\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you wouldn't believe some of the things I've heard! But of course, confidentiality is key in this job.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely, I respect that. Although, I must admit, the thought of it is intriguing.\nSpeaker 2: It certainly keeps the job interesting, I'll say that much.\nSpeaker 1: I can imagine! Anyway, I better get going. Lots to prepare for the boutique tomorrow.\nSpeaker 2: Of course, it was nice catching up. Best of luck with your preparations.",
