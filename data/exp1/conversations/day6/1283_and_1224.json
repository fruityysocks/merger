It's been a bit busy with all the end of the fiscal year stuff at work. \n\nSpeaker 2: I can only imagine. Since we're neighbors, I sometimes hear you during your late-night calls. It seems like a lot of work. \n\nSpeaker 1: Ah, I hope it's not too disturbing. The reality of finance, it never sleeps.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not at all, it's actually quite interesting. I usually work late too, with all the transcriptions I have to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, right! You're a transcriber. Must be nice to work from home, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: It has its perks, but it's not all roses, you know? It can get pretty solitary. \n\nSpeaker 1: I can imagine. All those hours, just you and your headphones. \n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly! It gets a bit...too quiet, you know? \n\nSpeaker 1: I get that. Sometimes I miss the buzz of working in an office too. \n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the finance world sounds so dynamic. I mean, always something happening, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, absolutely. The markets are always moving. It's challenging, but I love it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's important, loving what you do. With transcription, it's the variety of topics that keeps me going.\n\nSpeaker 1: Variety of topics, huh? That does sound interesting.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is! One day I might be transcribing a medical seminar and the next, a court proceeding. \n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, wow! That's quite a mix. Must be like a constant learning process.\n\nSpeaker 2: It definitely is, just like your field I guess, always evolving.\n\nSpeaker 1: True that. Well, I guess our jobs keep us on our toes. \n\nSpeaker 2: They definitely do, don't they? I suppose that's what makes them interesting.",
