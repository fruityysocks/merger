How about you?\nSpeaker 2: Ha, yeah, I hear you. Just been busy with yard work. I swear, the grass grows twice as fast in the summer.\nSpeaker 1: Tell me about it, I spend more time mowing than I'd like to admit. \nSpeaker 2: Well, at least it keeps us occupied, right?\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely, better than being bored, I always say. \nSpeaker 2: Yeah, speaking of which, how's work at the education center?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you know, it's challenging but rewarding. We're already planning for the new school year. How's everything on your end, still deep in computer codes?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you could say that. With so many people working from home now, there's been a big increase in IT issues.\nSpeaker 1: I can imagine. It must be really stressful dealing with all of that.\nSpeaker 2: It can be, but it's also kind of exciting. I mean, without these challenges, my job would be pretty boring.\nSpeaker 1: I get that. In education, there's always something new happening which keeps things interesting.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I suppose that's true. Well, I better get back to the yard work. Let's catch up again soon?\nSpeaker 1: Definitely, take care!",
