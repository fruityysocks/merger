By the way, your garden's looking splendid, as always. \nSpeaker 2: Oh, thank you. I've been working on it a bit more lately. And how has everything been at your end? \nSpeaker 1: All's good, thanks for asking. Been kept busy with work. \nSpeaker 2: I can imagine. Being a nurse must be quite demanding.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it can be. Especially these days with the pandemic and all. \nSpeaker 2: Absolutely, I can't begin to imagine the pressure. I admire your strength and dedication.\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that. It's tough but rewarding. And you're a consultant, right?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm a freelance consultant. It's quite different from being on the front lines like you, but it has its own challenges. \nSpeaker 1: I can imagine. Must be hard to keep up with all the changes in the business world.\nSpeaker 2: It is. It's a constant learning curve. Especially with all the changes brought about by the pandemic. \nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. I suppose we're all adapting in our own ways.\nSpeaker 2: Indeed. And sometimes the lines blur, don't they? I've found myself playing the role of therapist more often these days.\nSpeaker 1: I can relate. People are under so much stress and sometimes they just need someone to listen.\nSpeaker 2: Exactly. It's part of the gig, I suppose. \nSpeaker 1: It really is. Whether it's nursing or consulting, we're both in the business of helping people.\nSpeaker 2: That's a nice way to put it. After all, we're all just trying to make a positive difference.\nSpeaker 1: Couldn't have said it better myself. \nSpeaker 2: Well, it was nice catching up. Let's do this again soon.",
