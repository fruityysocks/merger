Been spending most of my time outdoors. You been enjoying your garden?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I have. It's my little sanctuary, you know. And how about you? Been busy with your flooring projects?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you bet! Seems like everyone decided to redo their floors same time. Keeps me on my toes.\nSpeaker 2: I can imagine! It must be quite physically demanding, your work.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's a workout in itself, but I love it. Makes me appreciate a good floor. How 'bout you? Consulting gig keeping you busy?\nSpeaker 2: Indeed, it does. The flexibility is a blessing and a curse sometimes. I'm often working odd hours.\nSpeaker 1: I hear ya. But must be nice not having to answer to a boss, right?\nSpeaker 2: That's true. I set my own schedule and rules. And I guess you have a similar kind of freedom, don't you?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but there's always a customer with an opinion. Can't please everyone, right?\nSpeaker 2: I couldn't agree more! It's all about managing expectations, in your line of work and mine.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am. Well, I got a job waiting. Nice chatting with you.\nSpeaker 2: Same here. Good luck with your project!",
